# Python-Discord-Bot
Here you can make your own python bot for discord. The code contains a lot of useful commands and explanations for them

I assume that you have installed the nextcord library and python)()()()()()()() and also on the website https://discord.com/developers/applications created a bot and ticked all the boxes

To start, create two files **Config** and **Main** 

The first one will store your token (*of course it is better to store such things not in code but using an environment variable*)

The second file will store the main startup code, and all other commands in **Cogs**
(Most likely you see the version now where my commands are written in the **Main** file because I remember python anew and get to know the nextcord library)
